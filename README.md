# ML Bootcamp by DJS Compute

Welcome to the official repository for the 2-day Machine Learning Bootcamp hosted by DJS Compute in association with DJS S4DS!

This repository contains all the materials, datasets, and code examples used during the bootcamp.

## Agenda

### Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning & Data Preprocessing

*   Introduction to basic Machine Learning concepts
*   Hands-on session with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn
*   Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
*   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the student performance dataset
*   Working with Jupyter notebooks (`ML_BootCamp_Day_1_EDA.ipynb`)

### Day 2: Advanced ML Concepts & Deployment

*   Building and evaluating Regression models (`ML_BootCamp_Day_2_Regression.ipynb`)
*   Classification techniques with real-world datasets (`ML_BootCamp_Day_2_Classification.ipynb`)
*   Model deployment using Streamlit
*   Building an interactive web application for grade prediction
*   Working with the coffee dataset for classification problems

## Repository Structure

*   `notebooks/`: Contains all Jupyter notebooks used during the bootcamp
*   `datasets/`: Contains the datasets used for analysis (student performance and coffee classification)
*   `app.py`: Streamlit application for deploying the student grade prediction model
